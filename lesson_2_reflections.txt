What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
>> a hidden folder .git was added. The 'git init' must be done before the first commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
>> staging area is a full/sub set of files in working directory. staging area with no history, but repository does have. it offers a flexibility in commit files to repository by add/remove file from/to the area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
>> I can use command 'git diff --staged' to compare different between repository and staging area. Then I commit the change after I verify that the change was what we expected for one specific logical change!
