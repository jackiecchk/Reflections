When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>> to share my files with others and/or want to keep my files in a safe place. namely github server.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository
>> as my remote repository might be updated by someone and the updated code is not what I wanted.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
>> forks is a repository copy within GitHub; clones is a repository copy from GitHub to local, or local to local; branches are paths within a repository. We use forks when we want a repository copy within GitHub. We use clone when we want a repository copy from GitHub to local.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
>> It will help to know any conflict between fork and local repositories.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
>> I have never collaborated with others. However, I do think Git and GitHub are great tools in collaborting with people in a project.
