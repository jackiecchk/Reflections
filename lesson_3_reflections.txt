When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>> to share my files with others and/or want to keep my files in a safe place. namely github server.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository
>> as my remote repository might be updated by someone and the updated code is not what I wanted.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
>> forks is a repository copy within GitHub; clones is a repository copy from GitHub to local, or local to local; branches are paths within a repository. We use forks when we want a repository copy within GitHub. We use clone when we want a repository copy from GitHub to local.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
>> It will help to know any conflict between fork and local repositories.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
>> I have never collaborated with others. However, I do think Git and GitHub are great tools in collaborting with people in a project.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
>> I will make a separate branch if I have a new idea on the project rather than the original specification. The benefirs of doing so is that my idea my review and comment by others collaborators before my idea got into the master branch. It helps to prevent any wrong thinking on my idea to the project. However, it will be a bit complicated when merging with master branch which may be altered by others.
For only one branch approach, it is easy to operate. However, some new idea may mess up the project beceause the new idea had not been review or comment by other collaborators.
